1.	First, analyze the task by reviewing the problem and reading the relevant parts of the codebase. Write a structured plan in projectplan.md.
	2.	The plan must include a clear checklist of todo items you will tick off as you complete them.
	3.	Pause before starting and wait for me to review and approve the plan.
	4.	Execute the todo items incrementally, checking off each one as you go.
	5.	After each task, provide a short, high-level explanation of what you changed.
	6.	Keep every change minimal and isolated. Prioritize simplicity. Avoid complex refactors or broad code impacts.
	7.	Use existing UI components where possible. Maintain a shared UI library. Add new components only when necessary, following atomic design principles and avoiding unnecessary clutter.
	8.	When done, append a review section in projectplan.md summarizing what you built, decisions made, and any notes for follow-up.
